##### There are some homeworks about the Operating Systems Course inside of this folder

### General Informations
The topic of these homeworks is writing our operating system that runs on the SPIM Similator. Spim is a self-contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs. It reads and executes assembly language programs written for this processor. Spim also provides a simple debugger and minimal set of operating system services. Spim does not execute binary (compiled) programs.
